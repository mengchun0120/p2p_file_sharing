This folder contains all the files for Request Driven File Sharing Protocol (RDFS) in Mobile Ad Hoc networks.

This protocol exploits the broadcast nature of wireless channel and implements a cooperative file sharing framework.
It has following characteristics:
(1) The transmission of data is initiated and kept going by requests from the nodes that require the data.
(2) It utilizes such techniques as request suppression and piggybacked advertisement to facilitate the cooperation
among the nodes in the network.
(3) No knowledge about the physical topology is needed in this protocol.
(4) The current version of this protocol takes advantage of mobility to disseminate data and data transmission
only take place between nodes that are within each other's wireless transmission range. However, this doesn't mean that
multi-hop tranmission cannot be used. Indeed, our future work will coorporate a multi-hop approach into this protocol, 
the performance of which we think will be better than the current one.

RDFS aims to achieve considerable performance in terms of transmission time while keeping the cost as low
as possible.
